# 13-Object-Relational-Mapping-ORM-E-Commerce-Back-End

## Introduction:
Our task wass to build a back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code that was provided to us. We were to configure a working Express.js API. In order to  use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the readme of your project.

I created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality:
